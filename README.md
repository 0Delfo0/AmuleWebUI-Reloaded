# AmuleWebUI-Reloaded #

A web interface for amuleweb. Reloaded style using Bootstrap, Glyphicons and jQuery!

## Credits 

This work is entirely based upon the skeleton provided in `amuleweb` package for Debian. Besed on the work and the efforts of the main _aMule_ branch developers, _Bootstrap_, _Glyphicon_ and _jQuery_, I've decided to re-design the web interface. All is released under the _Gnu Public License_, and I'll be pleased if someone will decide to fork and improve my work.

## Structure 

The structure is completely equivalent to the old `amuleweb` interface, and mantains all it's functionalities.
